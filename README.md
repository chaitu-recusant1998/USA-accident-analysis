Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Car Accident Data

This project involves the analysis of a comprehensive car accident dataset covering 49 U.S. states, with data collected from February 2016 to March 2023. The dataset, sourced from multiple APIs providing real-time traffic incident data, contains approximately 7.7 million accident records.

The primary objective of this analysis was to uncover key patterns and trends in the data, focusing on accident frequency across cities, time-of-day trends, weather conditions, and correlations with factors like temperature. Key findings include:

An exponential distribution of accidents across cities, with a small percentage of cities experiencing high accident volumes.
Peak accident times during morning and evening commutes, along with a notable pattern of accidents on Fridays.
A strong correlation between lower temperatures (particularly in winter months) and increased accident occurrences.
Insights into the role of weather conditions, such as clear and partly cloudy days, in accident frequency.
These findings highlight critical factors that could inform safety measures and further investigations, particularly regarding the relationship between temperature, visibility, and accident rates.
